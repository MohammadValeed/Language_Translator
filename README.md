# Python Language Translator

Certainly, here's a detailed description of the provided Python code:

**1. Importing Required Libraries:**
   - The code begins by importing necessary libraries:
     - `tkinter`: This library is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) for the translation application.
     - `googletrans` from the `googletrans` library: It provides access to Google Translate for performing text translation.
     - `LANGUAGES`: A dictionary of supported languages for translation.

**2. The `change` Function:**
   - This function is defined to perform the actual translation.
   - It takes three arguments: `text` (the text to be translated), `src` (the source language), and `dest` (the destination language).
   - Inside the function, it initializes a Translator object and uses it to translate the provided `text` from the `src` language to the `dest` language.
   - It then returns the translated text.

**3. The `data` Function:**
   - This function is called when the "Translate" button is pressed in the GUI.
   - It retrieves the selected source and destination languages from dropdown menus (`comb_sor` and `comb_dest`).
   - It also retrieves the input text from the `Sor_txt` (source text) `Text` widget.
   - Using the `change` function, it translates the source text to the destination language.
   - The translated text is then displayed in the `dest_txt` (destination text) `Text` widget.

**4. Creating the GUI:**
   - The code sets up the main graphical user interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library.
   - It creates a window (`root`) with the title "Translator," a specific size (500x700), and a blue background.
   - Labels, text widgets, and dropdown menus are added to the GUI to allow user interaction.

**5. Labels and Text Widgets:**
   - The GUI includes labels for "Source Text" and "Destination Text" to provide context.
   - A `Text` widget (`Sor_txt`) is used for inputting the source text.
   - Another `Text` widget (`dest_txt`) is used to display the translated text.
   - Dropdown menus (`comb_sor` and `comb_dest`) allow users to select the source and destination languages.

**6. The "Translate" Button:**
   - A button labeled "Translate" is added to the GUI. When this button is pressed, it calls the `data` function to initiate the translation process.

**7. Main Event Loop:**
   - The main event loop (`root.mainloop()`) is started, which keeps the GUI running and responsive to user interactions.

**Notes:**
- The code relies on the Google Translate service, which requires an internet connection for translation.
- Ensure that you have installed the `googletrans` library to use it for translation.
- Be aware of any usage limitations or requirements associated with the Google Translate service, such as the need for API keys or potential rate limits for extensive usage.

In summary, this code creates a simple text translation application with a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to input text and select source and destination languages for translation using the Google Translate service. The translated text is then displayed in the application's GUI.
